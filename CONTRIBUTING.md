## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) for dependency management
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for version control

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your_package_name.git
   cd your_package_name
   ```

2. Install dependencies with Poetry:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

3. Install pre-commit hooks:
   ```bash
   poetry run pre-commit install
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Code Style

We use [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for linting and formatting. The configuration is in the `pyproject.toml` file. To check your code:

```bash
poetry run ruff check .
poetry run ruff format .
```

### Type Checking

We use [MyPy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/) for static type checking. To check your code:

```bash
poetry run mypy your_package_name
```

### Running Tests

We use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for testing. To run the tests:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

To run tests with coverage:

```bash
poetry run pytest --cov=your_package_name
```

### Documentation

We use [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) for documentation. To build the documentation:

```bash
cd docs
poetry run make html
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes and ensure they pass all tests and linting.
3. Add or update tests as necessary.
4. Update documentation as necessary.
5. Submit a pull request to the `main` branch.
6. The pull request will be reviewed by maintainers.

## Commit Message Guidelines
